# `<NEXT_TURN>` Token Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented ephemeral `<NEXT_TURN>` token functionality that signals to the transformer when it's their turn without polluting the chronological history.

## Key Features

### 1. Ephemeral Token Delivery
- ✅ **Active player gets `<NEXT_TURN>`**: Token appears in observation for transformer input
- ✅ **Not stored in history**: Token is NOT persisted in chronological sequences
- ✅ **Non-active players don't get token**: Only the current active player receives it

### 2. Clean Player Identity
- ✅ **Clear identity from sequence**: Each player sees `<GAME_START> <PLAYER_X>` at start
- ✅ **No ambiguity**: Transformer can easily determine who they are from sequence beginning
- ✅ **Deterministic**: Player identity established at game initialization

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Token Vocabulary
```python
# Added to TokenID enum
NEXT_TURN = 51

# Added to token mappings
"<NEXT_TURN>": TokenID.NEXT_TURN,

# Updated vocabulary size
VOCAB_SIZE = 52
```

#### Interface Method
```python
def get_observation_tokens(self, token_state: TokenGameState, player_index: int) -> List[int]:
    """Get observation tokens including ephemeral <NEXT_TURN> if appropriate."""
    # Start with permanent chronological sequence
    observation_tokens = token_state.player_chronological_sequences[player_index].copy()
    
    # Add ephemeral <NEXT_TURN> token if it's this player's turn
    if player_index == token_state.active_player:
        observation_tokens.append(TokenID.NEXT_TURN.value)
    
    return observation_tokens
```

## Test Results

### Example Active Player Observation:
```
<GAME_START> <PLAYER_0> <YOUR_ROLE> <DON> <DAY_1> <MAFIA_TEAM> <PLAYER_1> <PLAYER_8> <NEXT_TURN>
```
- **Length**: 9 tokens (with ephemeral `<NEXT_TURN>`)
- **Stored History**: 8 tokens (without `<NEXT_TURN>`)
- **Improved Readability**: Role established before phase information

### Example Non-Active Player Observation:
```
<GAME_START> <PLAYER_1> <YOUR_ROLE> <MAFIA> <DAY_1> <MAFIA_TEAM> <PLAYER_0> <PLAYER_8>
```
- **Length**: 8 tokens (no `<NEXT_TURN>`)

## Transformer Usage Pattern

### Input Format
```python
# For active player
observation = game.get_observation_tokens(token_state, player_index)
# Returns: [...history_tokens..., <NEXT_TURN>]

# For non-active player  
observation = game.get_observation_tokens(token_state, other_player)
# Returns: [...history_tokens...] (no <NEXT_TURN>)
```

### Architecture Considerations
- **No sequence pollution**: History stays clean for training
- **Clear turn signal**: Transformer knows exactly when to act
- **Identity preservation**: Player knows who they are from sequence start
- **Scalable**: Works for any game length without bloating sequences

## Benefits

1. **Training Data Quality**: Chronological sequences remain pure game events
2. **Context Clarity**: Transformer gets clear "your turn" signal
3. **Memory Efficiency**: No storage overhead for ephemeral tokens
4. **Identity Resolution**: Player identity obvious from `<GAME_START> <PLAYER_X>`
5. **Standard Pattern**: Follows established game AI practices

## Integration with Transformer Training

### Recommended Usage
```python
def create_transformer_input(game_state, player_index):
    # Get observation with ephemeral context
    observation_tokens = game.get_observation_tokens(game_state, player_index)
    
    # Check if it's this player's turn
    is_active = observation_tokens[-1] == TokenID.NEXT_TURN.value
    
    if is_active:
        # Generate action using transformer
        legal_actions = game.get_legal_actions(game_state)
        action = transformer.select_action(observation_tokens, legal_actions)
        return action
    else:
        # Not this player's turn, wait
        return None
```

## Validation
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Token serves correctly to active player
- ✅ Token does not pollute history
- ✅ Player identity clear from sequence
- ✅ Turn transitions work correctly

This implementation perfectly addresses the requirements for ephemeral turn signaling while maintaining clean chronological sequences for transformer training.
