I am trying to build model of the game and find optimal strategy for each player and position.

Mafia Game description:

Game is played with 10 players, players are getting roles at random.

At the beginning of the game there's 3 players who gets Black cards (1 Don and 2 Mafia) and 7 players get Red cards
(6 Citizen card and 1 Sheriff card).

One team is playing against each other.
Three black players knows each other and red players do not know who is red and who is black.

Game is played with phases - "Day" and "Night". During day phase players are stating their position
 and make declarations, as well as put other player to the vote. Game starts with the day and player 1 making his statement.

Type of declarations players make (for this model):

1. "I think player X is a red player"
2. "I think player Y is a black player"
3. I am sheriff and checked player Z and he is black
4. I am sheriff and checked player M and he is red.
5. I am putting player K on the vote

Player can make as many declarations as he like (up to 9 declarations on the possible opinion and sheriff checks has to be believable
(if there's only two nights and player states has 3 checks that is suspicious)

This information is available to all the players.
