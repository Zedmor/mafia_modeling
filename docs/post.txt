Hi!

I am working on the implementation for DQN algorithm for one interesting game. This game is interesting because moves in this game are not affecting state of the game directly, but modify beliefs of other participants of the game and basically allow other agents to deduce role of other players in the game. It's game of "Mafia". Here's are the rules:

Mafia Game description:

Game is played with 10 players, players are getting roles at random.

At the beginning of the game there's 3 players who gets Black cards (1 Don and 2 Mafia) and 7 players get Red cards
(6 Citizen card and 1 Sheriff card).

One team is playing against each other.
Three black players knows each other and red players do not know who is red and who is black.

Game is played with phases - "Day" and "Night". During day phase players are stating their position
 and make declarations, as well as put other player to the vote. Game starts with the day and player 1 making his statement.

Type of declarations players make (for this model):

1. "I think player X is a red player"
2. "I think player Y is a black player"
3. I am sheriff and checked player Z and he is black
4. I am sheriff and checked player M and he is red.
5. I am putting player K on the vote

Player can make as many declarations as he like (up to 9 declarations on the possible opinion and sheriff checks has to be believable
(if there's only two nights and player states has 3 checks that is suspicious)

This information is available to all the players.

After day round of more than 1 players are been put to the vote, players vote and if one player gets majority he is eliminated from the game.
Eliminated player has opportunity to state his position.

During night Don decide who to kill in the game and that player is getting eliminated. If Don is not in the game first Mafia decides who to kill,
if only one mafia left, that player decides who to kill.

Then Don of the game if he is in the game can check if certain player is a sheriff card, he is getting back boolean True/False response.
Then Sheriff of the game, if he is in the game, can check if certain player is a mafia and getting response True/False (is that player mafia or not).

This information is private to the player.

After night killed player gets opportunity to make statement. After that next player starts round
(for example in first round player 1 starts the round, if player 2 killed on the first night, player 3 starts the round).

Game finishes with two possible outcomes:
1.  If there's even number of red and black players remains after vote or night Mafia (Black team) wins
3.  If all mafia is eliminated red team wins


I want to model this game with reinforcmenet learning.

I took very first approach with removing more complex roles (Sheriff and Don) and modeled this game using only Red and Black players (Citizens and Mafia) but unfortunately my network do not converge at all. I believe I am making some fundamental errors in how I approach this, so I put my efforts here: https://github.com/Zedmor/mafia_modeling

I am mostly interested in:

1. Is this correct way to represent state of the game (past actions): https://github.com/Zedmor/mafia_modeling/blob/6a3885a8c112e379bd373770e577e251f099a104/src/mafia_game/models.py#L322C5-L322C5

2. Is this correct way to work with action vector?
https://github.com/Zedmor/mafia_modeling/blob/6a3885a8c112e379bd373770e577e251f099a104/src/mafia_game/nn_policy.py#L77
 Player can take one of the follwing moves - nominating, voting, make declarations or killing (not applicable for citizens). So I mask part of the vector which is not applicable for the current move and encode mode player is about to make using state vector.

3. What would be correct NN architecture? I am using this, but it is very simple: https://github.com/Zedmor/mafia_modeling/blob/6a3885a8c112e379bd373770e577e251f099a104/src/mafia_game/nn_policy.py#L26 I tried to add more layers but no avail.

4. Is this correct way to setup reward system (I award player for making correct determinations based on information that is unavailable for player): https://github.com/Zedmor/mafia_modeling/blob/master/src/mafia_game/models.py

5. Is this correct way to train agent? https://github.com/Zedmor/mafia_modeling/blob/master/src/mafia_game/training.py

I would appreciate any help because I am in the very unchartered territory for me and I want to understand this field better but there's so much to learn.
