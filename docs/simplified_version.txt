This simplified version of the Mafia game is a good approach for testing and refining your Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementation. By focusing on a smaller number of players and simplifying the rules, you can more easily explore the strategic dynamics and validate the expected behaviors. Here’s how you can structure this simplified version and what to expect:

### Simplified Game Structure:

1. **Players and Roles:**
   - **Total Players:** 5
   - **Roles:** 2 Mafia, 1 Sheriff, 2 Citizens

2. **Game Phases:**
   - **Day Phase:** Players nominate and vote to eliminate one player.
   - **Night Phase:** Mafia chooses one player to eliminate. Sheriff checks one player to determine if they are Mafia.

3. **Declarations:**
   - On the second day, players can declare if they are the Sheriff and reveal their check results.

### Expected Behaviors and Strategies:

1. **Mafia Strategy:**
   - **Voting:** Mafia should consistently vote to eliminate red players (Sheriff or Citizens) to maximize their chances of winning.
   - **Deception:** Mafia players should consider falsely claiming to be the Sheriff to sow confusion among the red players and potentially protect themselves from elimination.

2. **Sheriff Strategy:**
   - **Revealing Role:** The real Sheriff should reveal their role and check results strategically, ideally when it provides the most clarity to the red team without risking immediate elimination.

3. **Citizen Strategy:**
   - **Support Sheriff:** Citizens should support the real Sheriff once identified and work to eliminate Mafia players based on the Sheriff’s information.

### MCTS Implementation:

1. **State Representation:**
   - Capture the roles, alive status, and current phase (day/night) in the game state.
   - Track nominations, votes, and declarations.

2. **Tree Structure:**
   - Nodes represent game states, and edges represent player actions (nominations, votes, declarations).

3. **Simulation and Rollouts:**
   - Simulate random plays from each state to estimate the likelihood of winning for each team.
   - Use heuristics to guide simulations, such as prioritizing actions that align with expected strategies.

4. **Backpropagation:**
   - Update node values based on simulation outcomes to inform future decisions.

5. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:**
   - Use a strategy like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to balance exploring new strategies and exploiting known good strategies.

### Potential Insights:

- **Optimal Deception:** The simulation might reveal optimal points for Mafia players to claim the Sheriff role, balancing the risk of exposure with the potential to mislead red players.
- **Sheriff Timing:** Insights into the best timing for the Sheriff to reveal their role and check results, maximizing the impact on the game’s outcome.
- **Voting Dynamics:** Understanding how voting patterns can be manipulated by Mafia players to achieve their objectives.

By focusing on these simplified dynamics, you can validate the expected behaviors and potentially uncover additional strategic insights. Once the MCTS model performs well in this simplified version, you can gradually introduce more complexity to approach the full version of the Mafia game.
