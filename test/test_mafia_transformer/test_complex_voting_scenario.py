Test complex voting scenarios with chronological sequencing.

This test verifies that the chronological sequencing system correctly handles:
- Night kills and death speeches
- Multiple nominations including mafia players
- Split voting (3-3-3 ties) 
- Revotes with same splits
- Mass elimination votes
- Complex multi-day sequences

Using seed 42 for deterministic team composition:
- Player 0: DON, Player 1: MAFIA, Player 2: SHERIFF, Player 8: MAFIA
