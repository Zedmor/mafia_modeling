Absolutely, here's a checklist for your project:

1. **Define the Game Environment**: Clearly define the rules of the game, the actions that players can take, the states of the game, and the rewards for different outcomes.

2. **Design the Networks**:
   - Design the architecture of the Policy Network, Value Network, and Role Estimation Network.
   - Decide on the type of layers (dense, recurrent, transformer, etc.), the number of layers, and the number of neurons in each layer.
   - Decide on the activation functions for each layer.
   - Decide on the input and output representations for each network.

3. **Initialize the Networks**: Initialize the weights of the networks with small random values.

4. **Generate Training Data**:
   - Use the Policy Network to play games against itself and generate training data.
   - Record the actions taken by each player, the declarations made, and the outcomes of the games.

5. **Train the Role Estimation Network**:
   - Use the training data to train the Role Estimation Network.
   - Update the weights of the network to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual roles.
   - Use a suitable optimizer, such as Adam or RMSProp, and a suitable learning rate.

6. **Update the Policy Network**:
   - Use the Role Estimation Network to update the Policy Network.
   - Update the weights of the network to maximize the expected future reward, as estimated by the Value Network.
   - Use a suitable optimizer and learning rate.

7. **Iterate**: Repeat the process of generating training data, training the Role Estimation Network, and updating the Policy Network until the networks converge to effective strategies.

8. **Evaluate the Networks**: Periodically evaluate the performance of the networks by playing games against each other or against human players. Adjust the training parameters if necessary based on the evaluation results.

9. **Implement Exploration vs Exploitation**: Implement a strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation, such as epsilon-greedy exploration.

10. **Regularize the Networks**: Implement regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, to prevent overfitting.

11. **Tune Hyperparameters**: Tune the hyperparameters of the networks, such as the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the learning rate, and the regularization parameters, based on the performance of the networks.

Remember, this is a complex project and it may require a lot of iterations and fine-tuning to get good results. Good luck!
