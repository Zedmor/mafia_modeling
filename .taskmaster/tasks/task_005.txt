# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Transformer Policy Network
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build transformer architecture (6 layers × 256 hidden × 8 heads) with factorized action space for token-based observations
# Details:
Implement transformer that accepts {public_tokens, private_tokens, legal_mask} observations using 50-token vocabulary. Factorized action space with separate verb and target heads. Legal action masking, seat rotation handling, shared weights between roles, policy+value heads for actor-critic.

# Test Strategy:
Network architecture validation, legal masking correctness, gradient flow verification, inference speed benchmarks
