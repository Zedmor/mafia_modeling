# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Self-Play and Historical Opponents
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create prioritized fictitious self-play (PFSP) system with historical opponent pool for diverse training experiences
# Details:
Implement opponent pool management, checkpoint freezing every 1M steps, prioritized sampling based on win rates, diversity metrics (KL > 0.3), and Elo tracking. Prevent strategy cycling through regularization.

# Test Strategy:
Diversity metric validation, Elo progression tracking, opponent pool effectiveness measurement
