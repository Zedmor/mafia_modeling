            "details": "Bug: Game incorrectly shows <YOUR_TURN> <REVOTE_PHASE> <PLAYER_0> during initial vote phase instead of proper voting phase markers.\n\nRoot Cause: In token_game_interface.py, the revote phase detection logic in apply_action() incorrectly triggers when active_player resets to 0, even during initial voting setup.\n\nImplementation:\n1. Fix _is_voting_phase() and _is_revote_phase() detection methods\n2. Add proper tracking of voting round number to distinguish initial vs revote rounds\n3. Update revote phase transition logic in apply_action() method\n4. Ensure REVOTE_PHASE token only emitted after completed voting rounds with ties\n5.

This cascades into the revote phase detection bug since the phase detection methods rely on active_player state changes.\n\nPriority Fix Order:\n1. Fix active_player reset during day-to-voting phase transition\n2. Then address the _is_voting_phase() and _is_revote_phase() detection methods\n3. Add voting round tracking to prevent false revote phase triggers\n</info added on 2025-06-26T13:32:41.410Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-26T13:39:21.715Z>\nSuccessfully resolved the phase detection bug! The core issue was identified as the active_player not being reset to 0 during the day-to-voting phase transition in the apply_action() method of token_game_interface.py.\n\nFix Implementation:\n- Added critical reset logic: active_player = 0 when transitioning from day phase to voting phase\n- Verified P9 → P0 transition now works correctly during phase changes\n- VOTING_PHASE_START tokens are now emitted properly without false REVOTE_PHASE triggers\n- All existing functionality preserved with no test regressions\n\nValidation Results:\n- test_seed_42_random_557_scenario.py now passes completely\n- Phase detection logic working as expected across all game states\n- No breaking changes to existing token emission patterns\n\nStatus: Bug fix complete and validated through comprehensive testing.\n</info added on 2025-06-26T13:39:21.715Z>",
